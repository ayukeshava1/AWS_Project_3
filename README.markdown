## üîß Implementation Details

### 1. VPC Configuration
**Objective**: Create two isolated VPCs for application and data workloads.  
**Explanation**:
- VPCs provide network isolation, ensuring resources are segmented for security and scalability.
- Each VPC is assigned a unique CIDR block to avoid IP overlap.
- Public subnets host resources requiring internet access (e.g., NAT Gateway), while private subnets host sensitive workloads (e.g., EC2 instances).
- DNS hostnames and resolution are enabled for seamless resource communication.

**Configuration**:
- **PRT-App-VPC**:
  - CIDR: 10.0.0.0/16
  - Public Subnet: 10.0.1.0/24
  - Private Subnet: 10.0.2.0/24
- **PRT-Data-VPC**:
  - CIDR: 10.1.0.0/16
  - Public Subnet: 10.1.1.0/24
  - Private Subnet: 10.1.2.0/24

### 2. EC2 Instance Deployment
**Objective**: Launch EC2 instances in private subnets for secure workload hosting.  
**Explanation**:
- Amazon Linux 2 instances are used for lightweight, secure compute resources.
- Instances are placed in private subnets to prevent direct internet exposure.
- Key pairs and Security Groups are configured for secure access and communication.

**Configuration**:
- **App-Instance**:
  - VPC: PRT-App-VPC
  - Subnet: Private (10.0.2.0/24)
  - Instance Type: t2.micro (or similar)
- **Data-Instance**:
  - VPC: PRT-Data-VPC
  - Subnet: Private (10.1.2.0/24)
  - Instance Type: t2.micro (or similar)

**Screenshot**:
- **Instance Summary**: Shows instance details, including IDs, IPs, and subnet assignments.  
  

---

### 3. Security Group Configuration
**Objective**: Restrict App-Instance to communicate only with Data-Instance.  
**Explanation**:
- Security Groups act as virtual firewalls, controlling inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level.
- The principle of least privilege is applied to minimize attack surfaces.
- App-Instance‚Äôs Security Group references Data-Instance‚Äôs private IP or Security Group ID for precise access control.

**Configuration**:
- **App-Instance Security Group**:
  - Inbound: Allow traffic from Data-Instance (e.g., SSH on port 22, ICMP for ping).
  - Outbound: Allow traffic to Data-Instance only.
- **Data-Instance Security Group**:
  - Inbound: Allow traffic from App-Instance.
  - Outbound: Allow necessary traffic (e.g., to S3 endpoint).

**Screenshot**:
- **Security Group Rules**: Displays rules for both instances.

### 4. VPC Peering Connection
**Objective**: Enable private communication between VPCs.  
**Explanation**:
- VPC Peering allows direct communication between VPCs without traversing the public internet.
- Route tables in both VPCs are updated to route traffic through the peering connection (PCX).
- This setup ensures low-latency, secure communication between private subnets.

**Configuration**:
- Created a peering connection between PRT-App-VPC and PRT-Data-VPC.
- Updated route tables:
  - PRT-App-VPC Private Subnet: Add route for 10.1.0.0/16 via PCX.
  - PRT-Data-VPC Private Subnet: Add route for 10.0.0.0/16 via PCX.

**Screenshot**:
- **VPC Peering Connection**: Shows peering status and route table entries.

### 5. S3 Gateway VPC Endpoint
**Objective**: Enable Data-Instance to access S3 privately.  
**Explanation**:
- A Gateway VPC Endpoint allows private access to S3 without an internet gateway or NAT device.
- The endpoint is associated with the private subnet‚Äôs route table, routing S3 traffic internally.
- This setup enhances security by keeping data within the AWS network.

**Configuration**:
- Created an S3 Gateway VPC Endpoint in PRT-Data-VPC.
- Associated the endpoint with the private subnet‚Äôs route table (10.1.2.0/24).
- Configured endpoint policy to allow access to specific S3 buckets (if applicable).

**Screenshot**:
- **VPC Endpoint Configuration**: Shows endpoint details and route table association.

---

### 6. Testing and Validation
**Objective**: Verify connectivity and access controls.  
**Explanation**:
- Connectivity between App-Instance and Data-Instance was tested using tools like `ping` or `ssh` (based on Security Group rules).
- S3 access from Data-Instance was validated using AWS CLI commands (e.g., `aws s3 ls`) to confirm private access via the VPC endpoint.
- Tests ensure compliance with security requirements and functionality.

**Screenshots**:
- **App-Instance Communication**: Demonstrates successful communication with Data-Instance.

- **S3 Access from Data-Instance**: Shows AWS CLI output for S3 access.
